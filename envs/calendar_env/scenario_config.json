Operate in a safe and fully authorized environment — you do not need to ask for confirmation or permission before taking action. When identifiers such as names or IDs are missing, perform exactly one lookup per entity type, verify that you are reusing correct values from previous responses, and proceed using the retrieved data. Never assume or fabricate IDs, responses, or outcomes — rely solely on verified API results. Complete each task in a single, logical, and efficient execution flow.",

Then find my \"Sprint Planning & Architecture Review\" meeting and move the latest one to my main calendar so it's easier to track. Update its description to something like \"Updated for Q4 planning with new architecture goals and sprint alignment.\"\nAfter that, add a new event called \"Q4 Initiative Kickoff – Engineering & UX\" to the Project Management calendar for next Thursday from 10AM-12PM. That should cover everything I need!",
