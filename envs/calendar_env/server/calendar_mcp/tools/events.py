                    Supported Recurrence Types:
                    
                    RRULE (Recurrence Rule) - Defines the pattern for recurring events:
                    • FREQ: Frequency (DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, YEARLY)
                    • INTERVAL: Interval between occurrences (e.g., INTERVAL=2 for every 2 weeks)
                    • COUNT: Maximum number of occurrences
                    • UNTIL: End date (format: YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ)
                    • BYDAY: Days of week (MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, SU)
                    • BYMONTHDAY: Days of month (1-31)
                    • BYMONTH: Months (1-12)
                    • BYSETPOS: Position in set (e.g., 1st, 2nd, -1 for last)
                    
                    EXDATE (Exception Dates) - Exclude specific occurrences:
                    • Format: EXDATE:YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ or EXDATE;VALUE=DATE:YYYYMMDD
                    • Use timezone format for timed events, date format for all-day events
                    
                    RDATE (Recurrence Dates) - Add specific occurrences:
                    • Format: RDATE:YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ or RDATE;VALUE=DATE:YYYYMMDD
                    
                    Common Examples:
                    • Daily: ["RRULE:FREQ=DAILY"]
                    • Every weekday: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR"]
                    • Weekly on specific days: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=TU,TH"]
                    • Monthly on specific date: ["RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=15"]
                    • First Monday of month: ["RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=1MO"]
                    • Last Friday of month: ["RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=-1FR"]
                    • Yearly: ["RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY"]
                    • Every 2 weeks: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2"]
                    • 10 times only: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;COUNT=10"]
                    • Until specific date: ["RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;UNTIL=20231231T235959Z"]
                    
                    Complex Examples:
                    • Weekly with exceptions: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=TU,TH", "EXDATE:20231024T100000Z"]
                    • Monthly with additional dates: ["RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=1", "RDATE:20231215T100000Z"]
                    • Every other month on 2nd Tuesday: ["RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=2;BYDAY=2TU"]
                    
                    All-Day Event Examples:
                    • Daily all-day: ["RRULE:FREQ=DAILY"]
                    • Weekly all-day with exceptions: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO", "EXDATE;VALUE=DATE:20231030"]
                    
                    Note: For all-day events, use VALUE=DATE format for EXDATE/RDATE. For timed events, use full timestamp format.""",

                    RRULE (Recurrence Rule) - Defines the pattern for recurring events:
                    • FREQ: Frequency (DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, YEARLY)
                    • INTERVAL: Interval between occurrences (e.g., INTERVAL=2 for every 2 weeks)
                    • COUNT: Maximum number of occurrences
                    • UNTIL: End date (format: YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ)
                    • BYDAY: Days of week (MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, SU)
                    • BYMONTHDAY: Days of month (1-31)
                    • BYMONTH: Months (1-12)
                    • BYSETPOS: Position in set (e.g., 1st, 2nd, -1 for last)
                    
                    EXDATE (Exception Dates) - Exclude specific occurrences:
                    • Format: EXDATE:YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ or EXDATE;VALUE=DATE:YYYYMMDD
                    • Use timezone format for timed events, date format for all-day events
                    
                    RDATE (Recurrence Dates) - Add specific occurrences:
                    • Format: RDATE:YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ or RDATE;VALUE=DATE:YYYYMMDD
                    
                    Common Examples:
                    • Daily: ["RRULE:FREQ=DAILY"]

                    Supported Recurrence Types:
                    
                    RRULE (Recurrence Rule) - Defines the pattern for recurring events:
                    • FREQ: Frequency (DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, YEARLY)
                    • INTERVAL: Interval between occurrences (e.g., INTERVAL=2 for every 2 weeks)
                    • COUNT: Maximum number of occurrences
                    • UNTIL: End date (format: YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ)
                    • BYDAY: Days of week (MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, SU)
                    • BYMONTHDAY: Days of month (1-31)
                    • BYMONTH: Months (1-12)
                    • BYSETPOS: Position in set (e.g., 1st, 2nd, -1 for last)
                    
                    EXDATE (Exception Dates) - Exclude specific occurrences:
                    • Format: EXDATE:YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ or EXDATE;VALUE=DATE:YYYYMMDD
                    • Use timezone format for timed events, date format for all-day events
                    
                    RDATE (Recurrence Dates) - Add specific occurrences:
                    • Format: RDATE:YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ or RDATE;VALUE=DATE:YYYYMMDD
                    
                    Common Examples:
                    • Daily: ["RRULE:FREQ=DAILY"]
                    • Every weekday: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR"]
                    • Weekly on specific days: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=TU,TH"]
                    • Monthly on specific date: ["RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=15"]
                    • First Monday of month: ["RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=1MO"]
                    • Last Friday of month: ["RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=-1FR"]
                    • Yearly: ["RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY"]
                    • Every 2 weeks: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2"]
                    • 10 times only: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;COUNT=10"]
                    • Until specific date: ["RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;UNTIL=20231231T235959Z"]
                    
                    Complex Examples:
                    • Weekly with exceptions: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=TU,TH", "EXDATE:20231024T100000Z"]
                    • Monthly with additional dates: ["RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=1", "RDATE:20231215T100000Z"]
                    • Every other month on 2nd Tuesday: ["RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=2;BYDAY=2TU"]
                    
                    All-Day Event Examples:
                    • Daily all-day: ["RRULE:FREQ=DAILY"]
                    • Weekly all-day with exceptions: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO", "EXDATE;VALUE=DATE:20231030"]
                    
                    Note: For all-day events, use VALUE=DATE format for EXDATE/RDATE. For timed events, use full timestamp format.""",

                    RRULE (Recurrence Rule) - Defines the pattern for recurring events:
                    • FREQ: Frequency (DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, YEARLY)
                    • INTERVAL: Interval between occurrences (e.g., INTERVAL=2 for every 2 weeks)
                    • COUNT: Maximum number of occurrences
                    • UNTIL: End date (format: YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ)
                    • BYDAY: Days of week (MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, SU)
                    • BYMONTHDAY: Days of month (1-31)
                    • BYMONTH: Months (1-12)
                    • BYSETPOS: Position in set (e.g., 1st, 2nd, -1 for last)
                    
                    EXDATE (Exception Dates) - Exclude specific occurrences:
                    • Format: EXDATE:YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ or EXDATE;VALUE=DATE:YYYYMMDD
                    • Use timezone format for timed events, date format for all-day events
                    
                    RDATE (Recurrence Dates) - Add specific occurrences:
                    • Format: RDATE:YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ or RDATE;VALUE=DATE:YYYYMMDD
                    
                    Common Examples:
                    • Daily: ["RRULE:FREQ=DAILY"]
                    • Every weekday: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR"]
                    • Weekly on specific days: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=TU,TH"]
                    • Monthly on specific date: ["RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=15"]
                    • First Monday of month: ["RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=1MO"]
                    • Last Friday of month: ["RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=-1FR"]
                    • Yearly: ["RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY"]
                    • Every 2 weeks: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2"]
                    • 10 times only: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;COUNT=10"]
                    • Until specific date: ["RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;UNTIL=20231231T235959Z"]
                    
                    Complex Examples:
                    • Weekly with exceptions: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=TU,TH", "EXDATE:20231024T100000Z"]
                    • Monthly with additional dates: ["RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=1", "RDATE:20231215T100000Z"]
                    • Every other month on 2nd Tuesday: ["RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=2;BYDAY=2TU"]
                    
                    All-Day Event Examples:
                    • Daily all-day: ["RRULE:FREQ=DAILY"]
                    • Weekly all-day with exceptions: ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO", "EXDATE;VALUE=DATE:20231030"]
