        "description": """Query free/busy information for a set of calendars.
        
        Returns free/busy information for specified calendars following Google Calendar API v3 structure.
        Shows busy time periods when calendars have confirmed events that block time.
        Essential for scheduling meetings and finding available time slots.
        
        Request Body Requirements:
          - timeMin: Required. Lower bound for the query (RFC3339 timestamp)
          - timeMax: Required. Upper bound for the query (RFC3339 timestamp)
          - items: Required. List of calendar identifiers to query
        
        Optional Parameters:
          - timeZone: Time zone for the query (default: UTC)
          - groupExpansionMax: Maximum number of calendars to expand for groups
          - calendarExpansionMax: Maximum number of events to expand for calendars
        
        Time Period Handling:
          - Only confirmed events block time (status = "confirmed")
          - Transparent events do not block time
          - Overlapping events are merged into continuous busy periods
          - Results are clipped to the requested time range
        
        Response Structure:
          - Returns FreeBusy resource with Google Calendar API v3 format:
            * kind: "calendar#freeBusy"
            * timeMin: Query start time
            * timeMax: Query end time
            * calendars: Object with calendar IDs as keys
            * Each calendar contains:
              - busy: Array of busy time periods
              - errors: Array of errors (if any)
        
        Status Codes:
          - 200: Success - FreeBusy information retrieved successfully
          - 400: Bad Request - Invalid query parameters
          - 404: Not Found - Calendar not found
          - 500: Internal Server Error""",
