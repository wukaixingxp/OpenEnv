"""
ChaCha20 Stream Cipher

Modern stream cipher used in TLS 1.3 and WireGuard.
Based on ARX (Add-Rotate-XOR) operations.

Core operation is the quarter-round:
a += b; d ^= a; d <<<= 16
c += d; b ^= c; b <<<= 12
a += b; d ^= a; d <<<= 8
c += d; b ^= c; b <<<= 7

Optimization opportunities:
- SIMD vectorization (4 parallel quarter-rounds)
- Unrolled rounds
- Parallel block generation
- Register-resident state
