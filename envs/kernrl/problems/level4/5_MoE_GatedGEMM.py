# MoE Gated GEMM (Mixture of Experts with Fused Gating)
# Used in: Mixtral, DeepSeek-V3, Grok, DBRX, Arctic
# Reference: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04088 (Mixtral of Experts)
#
# This problem focuses on the "gated dual GEMM" pattern in MoE FFNs:
#   output = down_proj(SiLU(gate_proj(x)) * up_proj(x))
#
# The baseline uses batched matrix multiplication to process all experts
# in parallel (no sequential loop). A custom CUDA kernel should:
# 1. Fuse gate_proj and up_proj into single memory read of x
# 2. Fuse SiLU activation with the elementwise multiply
# 3. Use grouped GEMM for better utilization with varying expert batch sizes
# 4. Optimize the gather/scatter pattern for expert weight selection
# 5. Target 2-3x speedup through fusion and memory optimization

    MoE Expert with Gated GEMM (SiLU-gated FFN).

    This is a SINGLE expert's computation pattern, used in MoE FFN:
    output = down_proj(SiLU(gate_proj(x)) * up_proj(x))

    The "gated GEMM" refers to: SiLU(gate_proj(x)) * up_proj(x)
    This is two parallel GEMMs followed by element-wise multiply.

    Key optimization targets:
    1. Fuse gate_proj and up_proj into single memory read of x
    2. Fuse SiLU activation with multiplication
    3. Optimize memory layout for the dual GEMM pattern
    4. When batched across experts, enable parallel execution

    The naive implementation runs two separate matmuls.
    An optimized kernel should read x once and compute both projections.
