"""
N-Body Gravitational Simulation

Computes gravitational forces between N particles using direct O(N^2) summation.
This is a classic GPU workload with high arithmetic intensity.

Optimization opportunities:
- Shared memory tiling to reduce global memory bandwidth
- Thread coarsening to increase work per thread
- Vectorized loads/stores
- Fast reciprocal square root (rsqrt)
