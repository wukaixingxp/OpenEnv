2D Stencil Computation - Heat Equation / Jacobi Iteration

Classic 5-point stencil for solving the 2D heat equation or Laplace equation.
u_new[i,j] = 0.25 * (u[i-1,j] + u[i+1,j] + u[i,j-1] + u[i,j+1])

This is a memory-bound kernel with regular access patterns.

Optimization opportunities:
- Shared memory caching to reduce redundant loads
- Loop tiling / temporal blocking
- Vectorized loads for coalescing
- Register blocking across multiple rows
