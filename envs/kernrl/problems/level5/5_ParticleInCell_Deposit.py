"""
Particle-in-Cell (PIC) Charge Deposition

Deposits particle charges onto a grid using linear interpolation (CIC - Cloud-in-Cell).
This is a key operation in plasma physics simulations.

Challenge: Atomic operations needed due to race conditions when multiple particles
deposit to the same grid cell.

Optimization opportunities:
- Sorting particles by cell for coalesced access
- Shared memory atomics with global reduction
- Histogram-style optimizations
- Warp-level vote/ballot for conflict detection
