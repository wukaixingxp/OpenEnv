"""
2D Wave Equation Finite Difference

Explicit time stepping for the 2D wave equation:
u_tt = c^2 * (u_xx + u_yy)

Uses leapfrog integration:
u_new = 2*u_curr - u_prev + c^2*dt^2*(Laplacian(u_curr))

This has similar structure to heat equation stencil but with temporal dependence.

Optimization opportunities:
- Temporal blocking to keep multiple time steps in cache
- Shared memory tiling
- Vectorized loads
- Prefetching for next timestep
