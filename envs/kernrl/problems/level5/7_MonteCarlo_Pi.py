"""
Monte Carlo Pi Estimation

Estimates Pi using Monte Carlo integration: count random points falling inside unit circle.
This represents a broader class of Monte Carlo integration problems.

The kernel involves:
- Random number generation (or processing pre-generated randoms)
- Point classification (inside/outside circle)
- Reduction to count hits

Optimization opportunities:
- Parallel random number generation (cuRAND)
- Warp-level reductions
- Persistent kernel for streaming random numbers
- Fused generation + classification + reduction
