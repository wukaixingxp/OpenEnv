2D Median Filter

Non-linear filter that replaces each pixel with the median of its neighborhood.
Excellent for removing salt-and-pepper noise while preserving edges.

Challenge: Finding median requires sorting - not a simple convolution.

Optimization opportunities:
- Histogram-based median (for byte images)
- Partial sort using selection networks
- Running median algorithms
- Separable approximations
