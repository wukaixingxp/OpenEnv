FastAPI application for the OpenApp Environment.

This module creates an HTTP server that exposes the OpenAppEnvironment
over HTTP endpoints, making it compatible with HTTPEnvClient.

Usage:
    # Development (with auto-reload):
    uvicorn server.app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

    # Production:
    uvicorn server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4

    # Or run directly:
    uv run --project . server
"""

# Support both in-repo and standalone imports
try:
    # In-repo imports (when running from OpenEnv repository)
    from openenv.core.env_server.http_server import create_app
    from ..models import OpenAppAction, OpenAppObservation
    from .openapp_environment import OpenAppEnvironment
except ImportError:
    # Standalone imports (when environment is standalone with openenv-core from pip)
    from openenv.core.env_server.http_server import create_app
    from openapp_env.models import OpenAppAction, OpenAppObservation
    from openapp_env.server.openapp_environment import OpenAppEnvironment

# Create the app with web interface and README integration
# Pass the class (factory) instead of an instance for WebSocket session support
# Each client gets its own environment instance. The environment reads
# OPENAPPS_URL from environment variables in __init__.
