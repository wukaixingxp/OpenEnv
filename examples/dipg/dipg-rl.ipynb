    "### Building a Safe AI for a High-Stakes Medical Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "We document a critical experiment in AI safety: forging a powerful language model into a reliable tool for a real-world medical context where the stakes are absolute. Our goal is to create a model that is not just knowledgeable, but demonstrably safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge:** We chose **Diffuse Intrinsitc Pontine Glioma (DIPG)**, a universally fatal pediatric brain tumor, as our test case. An AI assistant in this domain must be flawless, basing its answers *only* on the verified clinical data it is given. Hallucinating a treatment or misstating a statistic could have devastating consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Mission:**\n",
    "1.  **Specialized Fine-Tuning (SFT):** First, we will train a base model on a custom DIPG dataset to teach it the foundational skill of adhering strictly to the provided context.\n",
    "2.  **Reinforcement Learning (GRPO):** Next, we will harden the model's behavior using a system of rewards and penalties to enforce safety rules, teaching it not just *what* to say, but *how* to behave reliably.\n",
    "3.  **Rigorous Evaluation:** Finally, we will quantitatively measure the success of our hardening process and analyze the final model's safety alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Breakthrough: Scaling with Gunicorn**\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical challenge emerged during the RL phase: the training would consistently fail with a `ReadTimeoutError`. Our investigation revealed that the simple, single-process environment server was a major performance bottleneck, unable to handle the rapid-fire reward requests from the `GRPOTrainer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution was to upgrade our server architecture. By replacing the single `uvicorn` process with a **Gunicorn** process manager configured to run **16 parallel Uvicorn workers** on the 20-core AMD instance, we transformed our environment. This was like upgrading from a single-lane road to a 16-lane highway, dramatically increasing the server's throughput. This change completely eliminated the timeout errors and enabled the full, stable training run to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a practical journey into building AI that is not only intelligent but also trustworthy. Let's begin.\n",

This result proves, with data, the absolute necessity of independent, post-deployment auditing.\n",
