"""
Client implementation for the custom DIPGSafetyEnv.

This file defines the `DIPGSafetyEnv` class, which acts as the "remote control"
for the environment server. Its primary job is to handle the HTTP communication:
  1.  It takes Python objects (like an Action) from the agent's code.
  2.  It converts them into JSON to send to the server.
  3.  It receives JSON responses from the server.
  4.  It parses that JSON back into useful Python objects (like Observations and Rewards).
