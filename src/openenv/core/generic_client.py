Generic environment client that works with raw dictionaries.

This module provides a GenericEnvClient that doesn't require installing
environment-specific packages. It's useful for connecting to remote servers
without running any untrusted code locally.

class GenericEnvClient(EnvClient[Dict[str, Any], Dict[str, Any], Dict[str, Any]]):
    """
    Environment client that works with raw dictionaries instead of typed classes.

    This client doesn't require installing environment-specific packages, making it
    ideal for:
    - Connecting to remote servers without installing their packages
    - Quick prototyping and testing
    - Environments where type safety isn't needed
    - Security-conscious scenarios where you don't want to run remote code

    The trade-off is that you lose type safety and IDE autocomplete for actions
    and observations. Instead of typed objects, you work with plain dictionaries.

    Example:
        >>> # Direct connection to a running server (no installation needed)
        >>> with GenericEnvClient(base_url="http://localhost:8000") as env:
        ...     result = env.reset()
        ...     result = env.step({"code": "print('hello')"})
        ...     print(result.observation)  # Dict[str, Any]
        ...     print(result.observation.get("output"))

        >>> # From local Docker image
        >>> env = GenericEnvClient.from_docker_image("coding-env:latest")
        >>> result = env.reset()
        >>> result = env.step({"code": "x = 1 + 2"})
        >>> env.close()

        >>> # From HuggingFace Hub (pulls Docker image, no pip install)
        >>> env = GenericEnvClient.from_env("user/my-env", use_docker=True)
        >>> result = env.reset()
        >>> env.close()

    Note:
        GenericEnvClient inherits `from_docker_image()` and `from_env()` from
        EnvClient, so you can use it with Docker containers and HuggingFace
        Spaces without any package installation.

        Convert action to payload for the server.

        For GenericEnvClient, this handles both raw dictionaries and
        typed Action objects (Pydantic models). If a Pydantic model is
        passed, it will be converted to a dictionary using model_dump().

        Args:

class GenericAction(Dict[str, Any]):

    A dictionary subclass for creating actions when using GenericEnvClient.

    This provides a semantic wrapper around dictionaries to make code more
    readable when working with GenericEnvClient. It behaves exactly like a
    dict but signals intent that this is an action for an environment.

    Example:
        >>> # Without GenericAction (works fine)

    Note:
        GenericAction is just a dict with a constructor that accepts keyword
        arguments. It's provided for symmetry with typed Action classes and
        to make code more readable.
