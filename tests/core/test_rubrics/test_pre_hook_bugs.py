"""Tests for pre-hook and container execution bugs.

These tests verify:
1. Pre-hooks are called BEFORE forward() executes (not after)
2. Sequential doesn't call rubrics twice when async is detected mid-way
3. Container pre-hooks work in sync path

These tests currently FAIL due to implementation bugs.
